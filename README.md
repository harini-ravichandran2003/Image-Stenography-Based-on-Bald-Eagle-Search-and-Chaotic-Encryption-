Enhanced Steganography Security with BES Algorithm and Chaotic Encryption

This project introduces a novel solution to enhance the security of steganography, which conceals confidential data within images. Addressing contemporary challenges such as data exposure and method vulnerabilities, this approach combines the Bald Eagle Search (BES) algorithm with chaotic encryption for robust data embedding.

## Key Features:
Bald Eagle Search (BES) Algorithm: Optimally selects pixels by strategically identifying the best spots to conceal data, ensuring effective and secure data embedding.
Chaotic Encryption: Adds unpredictability to the embedding process, significantly improving resistance against potential threats.
BESOPS-CE Technique: Merges BES algorithm with chaotic encryption. Utilizes three strategies—selecting space, searching, and swooping—to find optimal locations for embedding secret data, ensuring efficient and secure concealment.

By integrating the BES algorithm’s systematic exploration with chaotic encryption’s randomness, this project aims to significantly strengthen steganography security, making it more resilient against evolving digital threats.
